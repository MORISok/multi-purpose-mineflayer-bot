# Prerequisites

Installing Node

Javascript, often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language designed for the web. It is what makes most interactivity on the web possible.
Node.js, often just Node, makes it possible to use Javascript outside of web browsers.

So the first thing you have to do to get started is to install Node. You can get it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
After it is installed, open a command prompt (also known as a terminal or console) and then type
```
node -v
```
If you have installed Node correctly, it should return a version number. Currently, the project runs on node.js version `v18.17.1`. If it says it can't find the command, try reinstalling it.

Javascript can be written in any basic text editor, but it is much easier if you use what is called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
An IDE will help you write code because it can give you suggestions, or tell you if your code has potential problems. A good IDE to start with is Visual Studio Code.

Node Package Manager (NPM)

The last thing you need to know is how to use the Node Package Manager.
NPM is automatically installed when you install Node.
NPM is used to get useful packages that other people created that can do useful things for you.
You can search for packages on their website, and then install them using the npm install command in your terminal.
To check if you have installed it correctly do:
```
npm -v
```

# Installation and Usage

After dowloading the latest [release](https://github.com/morisok31/atgmaildotcom_mineflayer_bot/releases/tag/v1.2.2.1), you need to unzip the file and take the folder out it to any directory (folder) on your computer. Then run the `installpackets.bat` file to install the packets, although if you are on MacOS, you have to follow [this](https://techanzone.com/how-to-run-bat-file-on-mac/) tutorial. After you have done that, to start the bot you have to do:

```
node index.js <host> <port> <[username]> <version> <[password]>
```

If you don't know what port the server uses, you can use [this](https://mcsrvstat.us/) website. Also the `<[username]>` and `<[password]>` fields are fully optional, you only use the `<[password]>` if you have an accual Minecraft account, and the `<[username]>` is there to determine what username you want the bot to have. If you use a "premium" Minecraft then it has to be a valid Minecraft account username, but if you do not, then you can use any username you want.

At first, it might seem hard and confusing, but you will get used to it! Once you know all the commands, you can start accually using the bot.
